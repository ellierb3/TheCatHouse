# The Cat House

## This is my C# project for Code Louisville. I have created a fictional pet adoption agency that focuses on rescuing homeless cats and adopting them out into the public.

### The features that I have implemented are as follows:

### 1. Implement a "master loop" console application where the user can enter commands to perform actions and exit the program.
### 2. Create an additional class which inherits from its parent. I have created the Cats class which inherits from the Info Class.
### 3. Create a list, populate it with data and retrieve information to display. I created List<Cats> and iterated through the list in my DisplayListOfCats method.
### 4. I used a LINQ query in my method YearlyAdoptionGraph to display the List<int> items that were less than 250.
### 5. I calculated and displayed data back to the user in my FollowUp method using DateTime and added 21 days to return the followup date.
